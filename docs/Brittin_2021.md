**Abstract**

-  Nerve ring is derived from integrating the volumetric reconstructions from two animals with corresponding synaptic and gap junctional connectomes (Cook et al 2019)
-  _C.elegans_ connectome is not invariant, but that a precisely wired core circuit is embedded in a background of variable connectivity, and identify a canditate reference connectome for the core circuit.
-  Using this reference, they propose a modular network architecture of _C.elegans_ brain that supports sensory computation and integration, sensorimotor convergence and brain-wide coordination.
-  These findings reveal scalable and robust features of brain organisation that may be universal across phyla.

**Main**

- invariant cell lineage and anatomy of _C.elegans_ might suggest that its connectome is too invariant
- small sample size of available reconstructions has precluded a reliable estimate of the reproducibility and variability of the synaptic connectome
- the synaptic wiring has been exhaustively characterised (ref to be inserted) but the spatial proximity of neurons is only partially described (ref to be inserted).

**Data**

- https://zenodo.org/records/4383277
- https://zenodo.org/records/4383277
- two complete volumetric reconstructions of the _C.elegans_ nerve ring from previously published EMs (ref.)
  -adult
  -larval stage 4 (L4) worm
- two series of EMs span approx the same vol. with a length of 36 micrometres, starting in the anterior and ending in the ventral ganglia
- the reconstructiosn of these two nerve rings provide the first complete, nanoscale-resolution datasets of all neuronal membrane contacts of any neuropil.
- "contactome": the set of membrane contacts of the brain
- they define two neurons as immediate neighbours if the membranes along their neural processes are physically adjacent in at least one EM.
- to characterise synaptic pathways within a spatial contex, they integrated volumetric reconstructions with recent rescoring of synapses on the same L4 and adult worms (Cook et al)
  -for validation and comparison with other datasets (White et al, Witvliet et al)

**Discussion**

- Despite the _C.elegans_ connectome being available for over 30 years, the delineation of functions within its main neuropil is still incomplete
- There are no physical boundaries within the nerve ring, but their analysis points to the spatial clustering of neural processes into 5 neighbourhoods.
- the concept of a reference connectome was key to their brain map and the modelling framework they sued to establish thsi reference can be accomodated for future connectomes.
- Connectome consists of a core, conserved circuit that is embedded in a considerably variable background
- Due to technical limitations of synaptic scoring, it is hard to determine the extent of the variability
  - requires multiple further connectomes
  - conserved synapes- like most variable ones- are constrained by the "contactome"
- If the baseline functionality of the animal is represented by a core circuit, the variable component could support redundancy, individuality and plasticity
