**Summary**

- Data
  - https://zenodo.org/records/4383277
  - https://zenodo.org/records/4383277
- two complete volumetric reconstructions of the _C.elegans_ nerve ring from previously published EMs (White et al. 1986)
  -adult
  -larval stage 4 (L4) worm
- two series of EMs span approx the same vol. with a length of 36 micrometres, starting in the anterior and ending in the ventral ganglia
- the reconstructiosn of these two nerve rings provide the first complete, nanoscale-resolution datasets of all neuronal membrane contacts of any neuropil.
- "contactome": the set of membrane contacts of the brain
- they define two neurons as immediate neighbours if the membranes along their neural processes are physically adjacent in at least one EM.
- to characterise synaptic pathways within a spatial contex, they integrated volumetric reconstructions with recent rescoring of synapses on the same L4 and adult worms (Cook et al)
  -for validation and comparison with other datasets (White et al, (1986); Witvliet et al., (2021))
