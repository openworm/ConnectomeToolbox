**Summary**

- It is an updated connectome using Elegance software for annotation of synapses.
- An extension of the previous reported pharyngeal connectome (Albertson & Thomson, 1976) by describing the connectivity with anatomical weights.
- They verified 94% (50/53) of the chemical synaptic connections between cell classes previously reported in the pharynx (Albertson & Thomson, 1976).
