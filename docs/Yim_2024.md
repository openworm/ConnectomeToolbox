**Summary**

- Reconstruction of chemical connectome of the dauer, a distinct developmental stage of _C. elegans_
- Uses volumetric reconstruction and automated synapse detection
- Theoretical analysis shows a considerable rearrangement of sensory neuron connections and an increase in clustering within motor neurons during this developmental stage
